# handlingbyfile
Mod for JC3MP - allows modification of handling data by text files. Data is loaded each time a vehicle is spawned (no need to re-start server).

Very beta.
Doesn't always work.
Not at all useful for public servers.
If custom handling is applied, more often than not brakes wont work.

nanos aware and working on it.
Meanwhile this is here for anyone wishing to play around with handling just for educational purposes.
